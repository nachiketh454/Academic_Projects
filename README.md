Extracted and processed 550,000 tweets by building a 3-table schema in SQLite for structured storage, incorporating user, tweet, and geo-location data. Optimized the extraction process by using batch inserts, reducing execution time significantly. The project showcased the efficient handling of large-scale datasets, with runtimes scaling approximately linearly across multiple executions. This streamlined approach enabled faster tweet analysis and facilitated querying of user-location insights for large tweet datasets.
